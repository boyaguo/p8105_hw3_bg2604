### Problem 1

```{r p1 Import and clean dataset}
devtools::install_github("p8105/p8105.datasets")
library(p8105.datasets)
p1_brfss=brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(locationdesc, into = c("state", "county"), sep = " - ") %>%
  filter(topic == 'Overall Health') %>%
  mutate(response = as.factor(response),
         response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))) %>%
  select(-locationabbr, year, state, county, response, everything())
```

#### Problem 1.1 In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?

```{r p1.1}
p1_brfss %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(year, state) %>% 
  summarize(count = n_distinct(county)) %>% 
  filter(count == 7)
```
Answer: According to the R output, CT, FL and NC states were observed at 7 locations.

#### Problem 1.2 Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010.

```{r p1.2}
p1_brfss %>% 
  group_by(year, state) %>% 
  summarize(count = n_distinct(county)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = count, color = state)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(alpha = .5) + 
  labs( title = "Locations in each state, 2002-2010",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of locations"
    ) + 
  theme(legend.position = "left")
```

#### Problem 1.3 Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State.

```{r p1.3}
brfss_p1.3 <- p1_brfss %>%
  spread(key = "response", value = "data_value") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter( year == 2002 | year == 2006 | year == 2010) %>%   
  filter(state == "NY") %>% 
  group_by(state, county) %>% 
  summarize(avg_excellent = mean(excellent, na.rm = TRUE),sd_excellent = sd(excellent, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)

brfss_p1.3
```

#### Problem 1.4 For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each response category (taking the average across locations in a state). Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over time.

```{r p1.4}
p1_brfss %>% 
  spread(key = "response", value = "data_value") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(year, state, county, excellent:poor) %>% 
  group_by(year, state) %>% 
  summarize(mean_excellent = mean(excellent, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_very_good = mean(very_good, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_good = mean(good, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_fair = mean(fair, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_poor = mean(poor, na.rm = TRUE)
            ) %>% 
  gather(key = "mean_response", value = "average_proportion",    
  mean_excellent:mean_poor) %>%
  mutate(mean_response = as.factor(mean_response),
  mean_response = factor(mean_response, levels = c("mean_excellent", "mean_very_good", "mean_good", "mean_fair", "mean_poor"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = average_proportion, color = state)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_line() +
  facet_grid(~mean_response) +
  labs(
    title = "Average proportion in each overall health response for years and states",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average proportion"
  ) + theme(legend.position = "none",axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```
