### Problem 1

``` r
devtools::install_github("p8105/p8105.datasets")
```

    ## Skipping install of 'p8105.datasets' from a github remote, the SHA1 (21f5ad1c) has not changed since last install.
    ##   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
p1_brfss=brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(locationdesc, into = c("state", "county"), sep = " - ") %>%
  filter(topic == 'Overall Health') %>%
  mutate(response = as.factor(response),
         response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))) %>%
  select(-locationabbr, year, state, county, response, everything())
```
