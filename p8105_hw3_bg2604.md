### Problem 1

``` r
devtools::install_github("p8105/p8105.datasets")
```

    ## Skipping install of 'p8105.datasets' from a github remote, the SHA1 (21f5ad1c) has not changed since last install.
    ##   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
p1_brfss=brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(locationdesc, into = c("state", "county"), sep = " - ") %>%
  filter(topic == 'Overall Health') %>%
  mutate(response = as.factor(response),
         response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))) %>%
  select(-locationabbr, year, state, county, response, everything())
```

#### Problem 1.1 In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?

``` r
p1_brfss%>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(year, state) %>% 
  summarize(count = n_distinct(county)) %>% 
  filter(count == 7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 3
    ## # Groups:   year [1]
    ##    year state count
    ##   <int> <chr> <int>
    ## 1  2002 CT        7
    ## 2  2002 FL        7
    ## 3  2002 NC        7

Answer: According to the R output, CT, FL and NC states were observed at 7 locations.
